# Theming &amp; Accessibility

DRAFT!

## Requirements

With Dark Mode a hot topic is in the block since 2017. Since 2019 it's default on iOS and Android 10 and suddenly becomes "default". The high contrast mode is available since ....
To be truly human-centred we should deliver the design in light mode, dark mode *and high contrast*. Fortunately Microsoft finally delivers--thanks to Chromium--a true browser with support for media queries. Delivering for high contrast is easy as cake now.
